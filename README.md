This Python program allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides an easy way to perform temperature conversions by handling the necessary calculations internally and presenting the results in a clear format. The program supports conversions from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin, and Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

The user inputs a temperature value along with its unit, and the program calculates and displays the equivalent temperatures in the other two units.
